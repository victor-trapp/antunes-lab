      "This project was built as a focused learning exercise to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving skills. Rather than just creating a working calculator, the focus was on understanding state management, event handling, conditional logic, and edge-case handling such as chained operations, resets, and invalid input. Through this process, I explored how UI interactions translate into application logic and how to iteratively refine clean, maintainable JavaScript.",
